## Just an example of how to implement PubSub and Cache servers
The project in it's early stages, although both servers are working properly, there are improvements to make

### TODO
- [ ] Add acknowledge support
- [ ] Cache server incoming connection should be parsed with regex
- [ ] PubSub queues list should be synchronized
- [ ] PubSub remove disconnected clients from subscribers list

### Run from cli

**PubSub**

java -cp libs/cache-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.opal.pubsub.PubSubServer [localhost, [port]]

**PubSub Listener**

java -cp libs/cache-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.opal.pubsub.client.Listener [localhost, [port]]

**PubSub Publisher Test**

java -cp libs/cache-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.opal.pubsub.client.Publisher [localhost, [port, [number of threads]]]

**Cache**

java -cp libs/cache-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.opal.cache.server.CacheServer [localhost, [port]]
